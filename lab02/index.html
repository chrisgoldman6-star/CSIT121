            <p>So this is my first time publishing a webpage about everything I learned in this module and 
                the resources that really helped me better understand the content and correct way to write the codes.
                This took me quite some time to learn because as you said it really is just like learning a new language.
                I had to really focus and stop myself even when that meant going over the recourses again and again unitl I could 
                answer any question I had without running bag to the module.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to actually use Headings correctly and hierarchy behind them.</li>
                <li>How to check for errors when it comes to hand written code.(I made a ton of spelling errors).</li>
                <li>Where to look up tags and what they mean.</li>
                <li>What exactly semantic elemets are and how to correctly use them.</li>
                <li>How to put HTML Symbols in the code.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here are the main resources that really brung it home for me and helped me IMMESELY with this module.
                Without these I doubt i would have had as much sucess in learning and retaining the content. I'll probably run to these pages for the entirety of the course.</p>
