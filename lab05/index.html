            <p>So this is my first time publishing a webpage about everything I learned in this module and 
                the resources that really helped me better understand the content and correct way to write the codes.
                This took me quite some time to learn because as you said it really is just like learning a new language.
                I had to really focus and stop myself even when that meant going over the recourses again and again unitl I could 
                answer any question I had without running bag to the module.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to actually use Headings correctly and hierarchy behind them.</li>
                <li>How to check for errors when it comes to hand written code.(I made a ton of spelling errors).</li>
                <li>Where to look up tags and what they mean.</li>
                <li>What exactly semantic elemets are and how to correctly use them.</li>
                <li>How to put HTML Symbols in the code.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here are the main resources that really brung it home for me and helped me IMMESELY with this module.
                Without these I doubt i would have had as much sucess in learning and retaining the content. I'll probably run to these pages for the entirety of the course.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">This W3 Schools page that details HTML Elements</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp">This W3 Page about Sematic Elements</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp">This page for how to write Symbols like Copyright</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p> In this lab module I finally got my hands on CSS and the introduction of it in order to style my page.
                I'm not gonna lie it really did take me a few double takes to even attempt to start using CSS but there were 
                resources on the W3 site that really helped me even if that meant going over it again and again. I had to take time out to go over my code in the stylesheet.
                I wouldn't say I had a rough time with it, just that it really had me thinking about what I wanted to do to the webpage.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to use and apply the id and Class selectors.</li>
                <li>How to add background images to my webpage.</li>
                <li>How to correctly use font sizes in CSS and what the sizes are.</li>
                <li>How to add colors to my text.</li>
                <li>How to change the font styles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Down below are the resources I ran home to when I needed help and clarity on properties and how to add or change
                things in the CSS stylesheet. I honestly had a fun time stressing over the appearence and how to make things look how I want it.
