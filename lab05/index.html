            <p>So this is my first time publishing a webpage about everything I learned in this module and 
                the resources that really helped me better understand the content and correct way to write the codes.
                This took me quite some time to learn because as you said it really is just like learning a new language.
                I had to really focus and stop myself even when that meant going over the recourses again and again unitl I could 
                answer any question I had without running bag to the module.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to actually use Headings correctly and hierarchy behind them.</li>
                <li>How to check for errors when it comes to hand written code.(I made a ton of spelling errors).</li>
                <li>Where to look up tags and what they mean.</li>
                <li>What exactly semantic elemets are and how to correctly use them.</li>
                <li>How to put HTML Symbols in the code.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here are the main resources that really brung it home for me and helped me IMMESELY with this module.
                Without these I doubt i would have had as much sucess in learning and retaining the content. I'll probably run to these pages for the entirety of the course.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp">This W3 Schools page that details HTML Elements</a></li>

            <p> In this lab module I finally got my hands on CSS and the introduction of it in order to style my page.
                I'm not gonna lie it really did take me a few double takes to even attempt to start using CSS but there were 
                resources on the W3 site that really helped me even if that meant going over it again and again. I had to take time out to go over my code in the stylesheet.
                I wouldn't say I had a rough time with it, just that it really had me thinking about what I wanted to do to the webpage.</p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to use and apply the id and Class selectors.</li>
                <li>How to add background images to my webpage.</li>
                <li>How to correctly use font sizes in CSS and what the sizes are.</li>
                <li>How to add colors to my text.</li>
                <li>How to change the font styles.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Down below are the resources I ran home to when I needed help and clarity on properties and how to add or change
                things in the CSS stylesheet. I honestly had a fun time stressing over the appearence and how to make things look how I want it.

            <p>In this next lab module I learned quite a bit about how web layouts work and the best design practices for these layouts that keep them user friendly and as
                responsive as possible. It was ineed quite a journey but as i've said before, as long as I go over my resources, even if its time consuming, its worth it. 
                That rung true when it came to this lab as it wasn't hard just complex like my professor told me. I used some of my professors
                code when it came to the div class and flex CSS and played with it to understand the content better.But
                the best design practices i've found is when chhosing web layout always keep mobile friendly in the back of your mind.
                This helped me check myself as I chose web-layout. It's why I chose to use flex and also I found that the navigations is also a huge part of a good design structure for the user.
            </p>
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>

                <li>How to add and use media quieres to my CSS</li>
                <li>How to use flexbox and a responsive web design</li>
