            <p>
                Let's see i'm from Philadelphia. I've only been in maryland for 3 years or so and I'm an huge nerd for books, manga, and computers. I'm not kidding about the book
                part especially. I will READ anything as long as its remotely interesting. I like feeding deer and have a collection of crocs (23 and counting). I have a library of
                books in my home and my favortie thing to eat is cheesecake.
