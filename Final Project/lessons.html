  <h1>Lessons Learned</h1>
  <p>
    Over the course of this semester, I discovered how important it is to build websites with a strong foundation in standards and accessibility. But this whole process i feel like took me way more time
    then I'd like to admit. I like that about html though and how it really pushed me to think and take pauses when it came to writing it and understanding the standards.
    I love how it can be somne simple and easygoing at first beforeew it gets so complicated and thats when it hits home on how much of a new language it is to me.
    HTML is a wonderful language and it truly is something i'm going to keep with me for the rest of my life.

    Another important lesson for me when it came to CSS was the value of responsive design. Creating layouts that adapt gracefully to mobile and desktop taught me to think about users first. Media queries, flexible grids, and accessible navigation 
    were not just technical requirements—they became tools to ensure that anyone, on any device, could interact with my work comfortably and this really made me think of how much work web designers have out for them. 
    This reinforced the idea in my head that good design is inclusive design. When you make a website well and avaialble to everyone then that means its a great one because EVERYONE can
    use and access it.
